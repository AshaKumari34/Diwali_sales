- Agriculture, Textile, and Construction sectors spend the least among all.
## Overall insight:
- The top 3 occupations (IT, Healthcare, Aviation) account for the majority of spending.

- Offer exclusive deals or EMI options for Banking and Govt employees to increase mid-range spending
- Design affordable packages, seasonal discounts, or installment plans for low-spending groups like Agriculture, Textile, and Construction to improve their participation.

## Who are the top 10 customers contributing the highest number of orders, and how can the company design loyalty programs to retain and further engage them?
used:-bar chart<br>
<img src='images/Top10.png' width=800 height=500>
## Observation:
- Top customer (User_ID: 1003476) has placed the highest number of orders (~100,000+).
- The difference between the top 3 customers is not very large, showing close competition.
- After the top 5, the order volume starts to slightly decline but still remains very high compared to average customers.
## Overall insight:
- A small set of customers (top 10) are responsible for a disproportionately large share of orders.
- This indicates customer concentration risk â†’ the business depends heavily on a few customers.
- At the same time, these top customers represent the loyalty and retention strength of the platform.
## Tips:
- **Customer Retention**: Provide loyalty rewards, exclusive discounts, or premium memberships for these high-value customers.
- **Upselling & Cross-Selling**: Introduce them to higher-margin or premium products.
- **Reduce Dependency**: Encourage mid-tier customers to increase purchases by running targeted promotions.
- **Risk Management**: If one or two of these top customers leave, revenue may dropâ€”so diversification is important.
