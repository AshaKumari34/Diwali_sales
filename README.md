## Observation<br>
**Medium Spender** 58.9%:-majority of customers belong to Medium Spender segment, providing a stable revenue base.<br>
**High Spender** 21.6%:-smaller number of customers, but contributing significantly to revenue.<br>
**Low Spender** 19.5%:-opportunity for targeted marketing and upselling to increase revenue.
## Overall Insights

- There is a significant opportunity to increase revenue by converting Low Spenders into Medium/High Spenders<br>
- Medium Spenders form the backbone of stable sales during Diwali.
## Tips
